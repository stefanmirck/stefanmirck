# Hi, I’m Stefan Mirck 👋

I’m a staff+ full-stack software engineer based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

I’ve been creating things for the web professionally since 2005 in many
different roles as an individual contributor and within engineering leadership.
I ❤️ working with web technologies and helping teams create beautiful,
accessible and performant products for the web.

_Currently available for a remote front-end or full-stack engineering role._
